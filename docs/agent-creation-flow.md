# AI Agent Creation Flow

This document outlines the step-by-step process of creating an AI agent in the Launchpad system.

## Overview

The agent creation process consists of multiple sequential steps, with progress tracking in Supabase for real-time status updates.

## Creation Steps

### 1. Store Initial Configuration
**State**: `storing_initial_config`

This initial step stores the basic agent configuration in Supabase:
- Agent name
- User ID
- Basic preferences
- Creation timestamp
- Initial status

**Technical Details**:
- Creates agent record in Supabase
- Generates unique agent ID
- Initializes progress tracking

### 2. Upload Assets to S3
**State**: `uploading_assets`

This step handles the upload of necessary assets:
- Knowledge base documents (optional)
- Agent logo (required)

**Technical Details**:
- Assets are uploaded directly to AWS S3
- Secure URLs are generated for each uploaded asset
- Progress tracking for multiple file uploads
- Validation of file types and sizes

### 3. Create Vector Database
**State**: `creating_vectordb`

This step is conditional and only executes if documents were uploaded in step 2.

**Behavior**:
- If documents were uploaded: Create vector database from documents
- If no documents: Skip to next step

**Technical Details**:
- Vector database creation from uploaded documents
- Storage of database connection details
- Error handling for processing failures

### 4. Update Configuration
**State**: `updating_config`

This step updates the agent configuration with all the new data:
- S3 URLs for uploaded documents
- S3 URL for agent logo
- Vector database connection details (if created)
- Additional metadata for deployment

**Technical Details**:
- Updates existing Supabase record
- Validates all required fields
- Prepares configuration for deployment

### 5. Deploy Agent
**State**: `deploying_agent`

This step handles the actual deployment of the agent with all configurations.

**Technical Details**:
- Environment setup
- Configuration injection
- Service deployment
- Health checks
- Error handling and rollback procedures

### 6. Finalize Agent
**State**: `finalizing_agent`

The final step ensures everything is properly set up and ready.

**Tasks**:
- Verify all services are running
- Check all connections are working
- Mark agent as ready for use
- Generate any necessary access tokens

## Progress Tracking

The system maintains the current state in Supabase and provides real-time updates to the UI. Each state includes:
- Current step
- Timestamp of last update
- Any error information
- Additional status details

## Error Handling

Each step includes:
- Validation checks
- Error recovery procedures
- User feedback
- Rollback capabilities where necessary

## UI Components

The creation process is displayed using:
- Multi-step progress indicator
- Real-time status updates
- Error messages when needed
- Loading states for each step

## Technical Considerations

- AWS S3 for asset storage
- Supabase for configuration and state
- Vector database for document processing
- Deployment system integration
- Real-time progress updates
- Error handling and recovery
- Security and access control
